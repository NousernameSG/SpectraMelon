## Introduction

'SpectraMelon' is a program made to analyse DFT spectrum data to extract it's peak frequencies, corresponding Q-Factor and percentage amplitude for research purposes. Future additions also aims to provide graph (FFT Spectrum) outputs and allowing users to get the programme to pick out specific frequencies of intrerest for cross data comparisons.
